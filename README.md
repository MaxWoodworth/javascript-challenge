# javascript-challenge

Thought this one would be a piece of cake. Struggled for some time, I wasnt a huge fan of the starter code given to us. It was difficult to use d3 with such a hardcoded chart. 

I forgot to reset the page at first and everytime I would attempt to filter it would add the filtered table to the bottom of the table created when loading in the first time. 

I also struggled with the nitty gritty things I always do. Staring at a line of code not understanding why it isnt defined when its simply a missing capital letter rather than a lower case.

All in all I thought that this assignment was a bit of a slower easier assignment than the sqlalchemy assignment but I know this was just a lead in to the plotly homework.
